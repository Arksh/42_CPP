## Introduction
Welcome to the 42_CPP project! This project is part of the 42 Madrid curriculum and focuses on C++ programming. It includes various exercises and projects to help you master C++. The exercises range from basic syntax and data structures to more advanced topics like object-oriented programming, templates, and the Standard Template Library (STL). Each project is designed to build upon the previous ones, ensuring a comprehensive understanding of C++.

## Installation
To get started with this project, clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Arksh/42_CPP.git
```
Ensure you have a C++ compiler installed on your machine. You can use `g++`, which is part of the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC). On Linux, you can install it using your package manager. For example, on Ubuntu, you can run:
```bash
sudo apt-get install g++
```

## Usage
Navigate to the project directory and follow the instructions in each exercise or project folder. Each folder contains a `README.md` file with specific instructions on what needs to be implemented. Each exercise has its own `Makefile` to simplify the build process. To compile the code, navigate to the exercise folder and run:
```bash
make
```
This will generate the executable as specified in the `Makefile`. To run the executable, use:
```bash
./<executable_name>
```
Make sure to read the comments and documentation within the code to understand the requirements and objectives of each exercise.

## Contributing
Contributions are welcome! If you would like to contribute to this project, please fork the repository and submit a pull request. Make sure to follow the coding standards and include tests for any new features. Before submitting a pull request, ensure that your code passes all existing tests and does not introduce any new issues. You can run the tests using a testing framework like Google Test. Additionally, update the documentation to reflect any changes or new features you have added.
